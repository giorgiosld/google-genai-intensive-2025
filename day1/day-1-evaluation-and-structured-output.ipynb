    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",

    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Model Architecture:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model. This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but incorporates a MoE approach.\n",
       "    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while keeping the number of parameters activated for any given input constant.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   The model was trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "    *   The training was distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training Data:**\n",
       "    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from many different domains, including web documents and code.\n",
       "    *   The dataset incorporates image, audio, and video content, making it a multimodal dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Training Phases:**\n",
       "    *   **Pre-training:** The model is initially pre-trained on the large multimodal dataset.\n",
       "    *   **Instruction-tuning:** After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "    *   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is done based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Long-Context Capabilities:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro incorporates significant architecture changes that enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The training process for Gemini 1.5 Pro involves a combination of advanced architectural choices (MoE Transformer), large-scale distributed training on TPUs, a diverse multimodal dataset, and a multi-stage training process (pre-training, instruction-tuning, and human preference tuning). A key focus is on enabling the model to handle extremely long contexts effectively."

       "Okay, let's break down the training process of Gemini 1.5 Pro, based on the provided document.  It's important to note that the document provides a high-level overview and doesn't delve into every single detail.\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Model Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is built upon a Transformer architecture, but with a crucial addition: a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer.  This is a sparse MoE, meaning that not all parameters are activated for every input.\n",
       "*   **Sparse Activation:**  A learned routing function determines which subset of the model's parameters (the \"experts\") are used to process a given input. This allows the model to have a very large total parameter count while keeping the computational cost of processing each input relatively constant.  This is key to scaling the model's capacity without a proportional increase in compute.\n",
       "*   **Multimodal Native:** The model is designed from the ground up to handle multiple modalities (text, audio, video, images) natively. This means it doesn't require separate pre-processing or embedding steps for each modality before feeding it into the core Transformer.  The model can process interleaved data from different modalities in the same input sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Training Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Multimodal and Multilingual:** The training dataset is a diverse collection of data from various sources, including:\n",
       "    *   Web documents\n",
       "    *   Code\n",
       "    *   Images\n",
       "    *   Audio\n",
       "    *   Video\n",
       "*   **Pre-training:** The model is first pre-trained on this massive dataset. The pre-training objective is likely next-token prediction (or a similar objective) across all modalities. This allows the model to learn general representations of language, code, and other data types.\n",
       "*   **Instruction Tuning:** After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses. This step aligns the model's behavior with human preferences and makes it more useful for downstream tasks.\n",
       "*   **Human Preference Data:** Further tuning is performed based on human preference data. This likely involves training a reward model based on human feedback and then using reinforcement learning to optimize the model's behavior according to the reward model.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **TPUv4 Accelerators:** The model is trained on Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "*   **Large-Scale Distributed Training:** The training is distributed across multiple 4096-chip pods of TPUv4 accelerators, spanning multiple datacenters. This is necessary to handle the massive scale of the model and the training data.\n",

       "*   **Optimization Algorithm:** The document doesn't specify the optimization algorithm, but it's likely a variant of Adam or a similar adaptive optimizer.\n",
       "*   **Loss Function:** The pre-training loss function is likely the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the next token, which is a standard loss function for language models.\n",
       "*   **Regularization:** Techniques like dropout, weight decay, or other forms of regularization are likely used to prevent overfitting.\n",
       "*   **Scaling Laws:** The document mentions that language models follow a power law in terms of training compute to model performance (NLL). This suggests that the training process is carefully monitored to ensure that the model is scaling effectively with increasing compute.\n",
       "*   **Long-Context Training:** A key aspect of the training process is likely to be the handling of extremely long contexts. The document mentions that the model incorporates architecture changes that enable long-context understanding without degrading performance. This may involve techniques like:\n",
       "    *   Relative positional embeddings\n",
       "    *   Attention mechanisms that are more efficient for long sequences\n",
       "    *   Memory-augmented architectures\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Key Innovations for Long Context:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Architecture Changes:** The document highlights \"significant architecture changes\" that enable the model to handle inputs up to 10 million tokens without performance degradation.  While the specific details aren't provided, these changes are crucial for the model's long-context capabilities.\n",
       "*   **Data and Optimization:** Improvements across the entire model stack (architecture, data, optimization, and systems) contribute to the model's ability to handle long contexts efficiently.\n",
       "\n",
       "**6. Evaluation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Diagnostic Evaluations:** The model is evaluated on a variety of diagnostic tasks, such as perplexity over long sequences and needle-in-a-haystack retrieval.\n",
       "*   **Realistic Evaluations:** The model is also evaluated on more realistic tasks, such as long-document QA, long-context ASR, and learning to translate a new language from a single book.\n",
       "*   **Core Capability Evaluations:** The model's performance on core capabilities (e.g., math, science, reasoning, coding, multilinguality) is also evaluated to ensure that the long-context capabilities do not come at the expense of other important skills.\n",
       "\n",
       "**7. Responsible Deployment:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Impact Assessment:** A model impact assessment is conducted to identify, assess, and document key downstream societal benefits and harms associated with the model.\n",
       "*   **Safety Mitigations:** Safety mitigations are implemented to address potential harms, such as hate speech, harassment, and dangerous content. These mitigations involve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF).\n",
       "*   **Evaluation and Assurance:** The model is evaluated on a range of safety metrics to ensure that the mitigations are effective.\n",

       "The training of Gemini 1.5 Pro involves a combination of a novel MoE Transformer architecture, a massive and diverse training dataset, large-scale distributed training on TPUv4 accelerators, and careful attention to both performance and safety.

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn more\n",
    "\n",
